<ul>
<li>These are the original files I used to create the PiPad. The frame made from .5" Baltic Birch plywood.</li>
<li>All files were created in Vectric's Aspire CAD/CAM software (could also use V-Carve Pro.) The original file is PiPad.CRV3D. The rest (.DXF, .AI, .SVG, ETC) are exports from this file.
